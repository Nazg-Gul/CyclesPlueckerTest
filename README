Standalone pluecker intersection test application

Currently only hard-coded to Linux.

For MSVC it seems th following flags are to be used:

  /arch:AVX /arch:AVX2 /fp:fast -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS /GS-

There is enabled USE_PLUECKER in main.cc. If that line is commented out
then the old Woop intersection is used.

If vectorization of cross(float3) is disabled it makes intersection
test faster.
